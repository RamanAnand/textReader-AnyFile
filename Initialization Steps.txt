STEPS TO INSTALL AND CONFIGURE OPENCV ::

download openCV pack from https://opencv.org/releases.html (opencv-3.4.5-vc14_vc15) --> verified version

Install exe in some folder of your choice

We need two file 
C:\...\opencv\build\java\opencv-3xx.jar and 
C:\...\OpenCV\opencv\build\java\x64\opencv_java3xx.dll --> xx is version of opencv downloaded

we create user library in eclipse:
a) open >> BuildPath >>User Libraries >> New >> provide name for library 
b) select newly created library >> Edit >> browse to select "opencv-3xx.jar"
c) Extend it and select Native library location >> Edit
d) select external folder and browse to select opencv libraries "C:\...\OpenCV\opencv\build\java\x64"

STEP TO INSTALL AND CONFIGURE TESSERACT ::

1) Download your language files from https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/tree/3.04.00
For example, for eng, I downloaded all files with eng prefix.

2) Put them into tessdata directory inside of some folder. Add this folder into System Path variables as TESSDATA_PREFIX.
Result will be System env var: TESSDATA_PREFIX=D:/Java/OCR 
And OCR folder has tessdata folder with languages files.
